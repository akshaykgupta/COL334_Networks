Usage Instructions:
It is required that you run it from the src directory.

python Q4.py <path-to-objt/har> <max_tcp> <max_obj> <index_file> <save_directory>

eg :
	python Q4.py "../dump/www.vox.com.objt" 5 5 "index-1" "download-1"

Index File:
	Since some urls are longer than maximum allowed length of filenames, our script maps each url to a number. The content received from the url is then saved in a file of that number ( with a .txt extension ). The index file contains this mapping in the format of:
		<number> <url>
	eg : if example.com/eg.html was given the number 3, you will find the following line in the index file:
		3 example.com/eg.html
	At the same time, the content of the same url will be saved in a file called "3.txt"
