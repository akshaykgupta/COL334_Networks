Q4.py :

Modules necessary : pyshark
Input:
	1. either a .har files, or a .objt (object tree produced by Q3.py) file
	2. parameters - maximum number of tcp connections per domain and maximum number of objects per tcp connection
	3. name of index file 
	4. name of directory in which to keep the downloaded files.

Output:
	1. All the downloaded files are saved in the directory mentioned as input. Do note that they are saved according to their domain.
	2. Page load time is displayed on console.

Usage Instructions:
It is required that you run it from the src directory.

python Q4.py <path-to-objt/har> <max_tcp> <max_obj> <index_file> <save_directory>

eg :
	python Q4.py "../dump/www.vox.com.objt" 5 5 "index-1" "download-1"
	<index_file> and <save_directory> are optional, with default values being “Mapping.txt” and “dl” respectively.

Index File:
	Since some urls are longer than maximum allowed length of filenames, our script maps each url to a number. The content received from the url is then saved in a file of that number ( with a .txt extension ). The index file contains this mapping in the format of:
		<number> <url>
	eg : if example.com/eg.html was indexed as 3, you will find the following line in the index file:
		3 example.com/eg.html
	At the same time, the content of the same url will be saved in a file called "3.txt" inside the folder corresponding to <save_directory>/<domain_name> (e.g: dl/example.com)

timing.py:
	This is the script that we used to get times according to various parameters.

	Input:
		1. either a .har or a .objt (object tree) file
		2. upper limit on tcp-parameter
		3. upper limit on obj-parameter

	Output:
		1. All the saved files and mappings for each possible combination of parameters
		2. a timing_analysis.data file which records time taken for each set of paramters. The values are tab seperated.

	Usage :

		python timing.py <path-to-objt/har> <max_max_tcp> <max_max_obj>

		eg: python timing.py "../dump/www.vox.com.objt" 8 8
