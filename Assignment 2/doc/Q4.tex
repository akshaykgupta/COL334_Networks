\noindent { We made a python script ( Q4.py ) on the two Object Tree files, namely, www.nytimes.com.objt and www.vox.com.objt. All data collection was performed on the same network, i.e, Airtel Broadband }
\\\\\\
{\bfseries Q4a. Overview} %TODO : Brief overview of code?
\\The script takes in as input an \texttt{Object Tree} or a \texttt{HAR file}, the \texttt{maximum allowed TCP connections} per domain, and the \texttt{maximum number of objects} per TCP connection. If the input is a \texttt{HAR file}, it is first converted to an \texttt{Object Tree} and then processed. \\
Each layer of the \texttt{Object Tree} is processed sequentially, i.e objects of parents are downloaded before the objects of the children. At every layer, objects belonging to a domain are passed to the thread.\\ 
In the thread, at any given time, \texttt{TCP connections} $\leq$ \texttt{(TCP connections)$_{max}$} are opened in parallel to the domain in consideration, with each TCP connection requesting and downloading \texttt{objects} $\leq$ \texttt{(objects)$_{max}$}. Downloading across domains is done in parallel on separate threads.

{\bfseries Q4c.} %TODO
\\The parameters obtained from Q3c. were :
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{nytimes}: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item TCP Connections:
	\item Number of Objects:
	\item Browser Time:
	\item Downloader Time:
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{vox}:
\begin{itemize}
